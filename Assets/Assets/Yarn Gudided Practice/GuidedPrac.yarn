In this section, we’ll cover practical tasks like replacing a faulty water pump, balancing pH levels, and cleaning a mechanical filter.
Don’t worry! I’ll guide you through each step, and you’ll have all the tools you need to succeed.
Remember, the goal is to master these skills so you can handle real-life challenges with confidence.
