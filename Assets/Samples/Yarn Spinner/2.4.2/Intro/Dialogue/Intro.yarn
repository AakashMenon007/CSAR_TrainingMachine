Congratulations on completing the Knowledge Building section! You've taken your first step. #line:1
Now, let’s test your skills with hands-on practice in our virtual recirculating Multitrophic system.#line:2

In this session, we’ll tackle tasks like replacing a faulty pump, balancing pH, engaging backup generators, and sanitizing tanks.#line:3
I’ll guide you every step of the way, so let’s dive in!#line:4

<<wait 2>>

Have a look at the checklist tablet next to the control panel, you can grab it and move around as well, press the thumbstick button downwards to scroll down the tasks.#line:5
Lets Start with sanitizing the tanks #line:6

Grab the sanitizing can from the shelf.#line:7

Identify tanks with decolorized water and sanitize them.#line:8

Return the can and check off the task on the menu.#line:9

Sanitization is essential for maintaining aquatic health. Once done, we’ll move on to the next challenge. Let’s get started!#line:10

Congratulations on completing the first task! #line:11
Now, let’s move on to the next task, replacing a faulty water pump. #line:12

<<wait 2>>
Look at the light indicators in front of the three water pumps on each side of sections A and B. #line:13
Green indicates the pump is functioning properly.Red means the pump is faulty and needs to be replaced. #line:14
Find the faulty pump and ensure you turn off the valve located above and behind it to prevent water overflow. Carefully remove the pump and place it on the shelf. #line:15
Next, grab a replacement pump from the shelf and attach it in place of the old one. #line:16
Once you’ve replaced the pump, double-check its indicator to ensure it’s now green. #line:17
When everything looks good, check off the task on your menu. #line:18
Replacing faulty pumps is vital for maintaining the efficiency of the recirculating system. Let’s keep the system running smoothly! #line:19

Well done on completing the previous task! Now, let’s move on to the next critical task, regulating the oxygen level. #line:20
<<wait 2>>
Maintaining proper oxygen levels is essential for the health and survival of aquatic life. #line:21
The oxygen pressure (PSI) in the system should always be kept between 30 and 40 PSI. #line:22
Head over to the oxygen cylinder. You’ll see a wheel that allows you to regulate the oxygen level. #line:23
Turn the wheel to the right to increase the oxygen level and Turn the wheel to the left to decrease it. #line:24
Keep an eye on the gauge to ensure the PSI stays within the safe range. #line:25
Once the oxygen level is properly regulated, check off this task on your menu. When you’re ready, we’ll move on to the next challenge. #line:26

Great work on the previous task!Now, let’s focus on regulating the water temperature. #line:27
<<wait 2>>
Proper water temperature is crucial for aquatic life. The optimal range is 25 to 28°C. Head over to the control panel on the side, and locate the slider under Temperature Control. #line:28
Adjust the slider until the red light indicator turns green, signaling that the temperature is within the ideal range. #line:29
If you see the orange warning indicator, an alarm might sound to indicate a rise or drop in temperature. In that case, quickly adjust the slider to bring the temperature back to the safe range.#line:30
Once the temperature is stable and the green light is on, check this task off your list. #line:31
Maintaining the correct temperature ensures a healthy and thriving aquatic environment. Let’s keep it steady! #line:32

title:phcontrol
---
Now, it’s time to regulate the pH levels.#line:33
<<wait 2>>
Maintaining the correct pH is vital for the aquatic ecosystem. The optimal pH range should be between 6.5 and 7.5. #line:34
Go to the control panel, and locate the pH knob.Turn the knob clockwise to increase the pH level.Turn it counterclockwise to decrease the pH level.#line:35
Keep adjusting the knob until the red light indicator turns green, signaling that the pH is within the safe range. #line:36
If you see the orange warning light, it might indicate an imbalance. Quickly adjust the knob to restore proper levels. #line:37
Once the pH is stabilized and the green light is on, check this task off your list. #line:38
Great work ensuring the water chemistry is balanced for optimal aquatic health! #line:39

title:backupgen
---
Great job so far! Let’s move on to a critical task, turning on the backup generators during a power outage.#line:40
<<wait 2>>
In the event of a power outage, you’ll hear an alarm signaling the situation.Quickly locate the generator at the corner of the room. #line:41
To activate the backup generators Pull the stick downwards to turn them on, Check for the green light indicator to ensure the generators are running properly.#line:42
Backup generators are essential to maintaining system functionality and the well-being of aquatic life during outages. #line:43
Once the generators are on and stable, check this task off your list. You’re doing an amazing job keeping the system resilient under challenging conditions! #line:44
